## Project Description:
This Challenge was the first homework assignment of the UTA-Bootcamp. Our task was to refactor an exisiting wepage to improve its accessibility. It was completed using semantic HTML and CSS elements.

## Summary:

By leveraging HTML semantic elements and removing non-semantic elements, I was able to effectively increase the accesibility of this web page. Additionally, by adding alt tags to images, I further increased accessibility.
